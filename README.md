        I'm creating a simple online treasure hunt game called "Find the Best Karak" using HTML and JavaScript. The game will provide clues based on touristic places in Qatar, and the player will enter the name of the location to proceed.
        Please help me generate the basic HTML and JavaScript files needed for this game.The HTML file will include a heading, a paragraph to display clues, an input field for the player to enter the location, and a submit button. The JavaScript file will contain the logic for generating clues and checking the player's input.
